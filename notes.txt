I need to check appearance of this keywords in chat for 10 sec. Let me explain 
chat goes. I need to take each 10 sec segment and check is there amount of keywords > then 5 let's say. If it's true - add timestamp and continue. If keyword matches once again in the next segment - it should be added to previous timestamps

To implement the functionality you described, you will need to modify the script to analyze the chat messages in 10-second segments and check if the count of keyword appearances within each segment exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 5). If it does, you'll record the timestamp. If the keywords match again in the next segment, you'll extend the duration based on these new timestamps.

Here's an example Python script for this:

python
Copy code
import json

def find_high_activity_segments(chat_file, keywords, segment_length=10, threshold=5):
    with open(chat_file, 'r') as file:
        chat_data = json.load(file)

    # Convert chat data to a list of (timestamp, message) tuples
    chat_tuples = [(msg.get("timestamp", 0), msg.get("message", "")) for msg in chat_data]

    segments = []
    start_time = 0
    keyword_count = 0

    for timestamp, text in chat_tuples:
        # Check if current message still falls within the current 10-second segment
        if timestamp - start_time < segment_length:
            if any(keyword.lower() in text.lower() for keyword in keywords):
                keyword_count += 1
        else:
            # If keyword count exceeds threshold, record the segment
            if keyword_count >= threshold:
                if segments and start_time == segments[-1][1]:
                    # Extend the last segment
                    segments[-1] = (segments[-1][0], timestamp)
                else:
                    # Start a new segment
                    segments.append((start_time, timestamp))

            # Reset for the next segment
            start_time = timestamp
            keyword_count = 1 if any(keyword.lower() in text.lower() for keyword in keywords) else 0

    # Check for the last segment
    if keyword_count >= threshold and (not segments or start_time != segments[-1][1]):
        segments.append((start_time, chat_tuples[-1][0]))

    return segments

# Example usage
chat_file = 'path_to_your_chat_file.json'
keywords = ['keyword1', 'keyword2']  # Replace with your keywords
segments = find_high_activity_segments(chat_file, keywords)

print(segments)





Since you are building this project for yourself and do not require a frontend, focusing on the backend components will be key. Here’s a more streamlined approach for your project architecture, considering it will eventually be deployed on a server:

1. Video Conversion
Tool: Use the Python Video Converter library as a wrapper around FFmpeg. This library supports asynchronous operations, allowing you to handle multiple video conversions in parallel.
Implementation: Write a Python script that monitors a designated directory for new .ts files and converts them into your desired format (e.g., MP4).
2. Chat Log Analysis
Functionality: Create a Python script to parse JSON chat logs, identify high-activity segments based on keyword frequency within specific time intervals, and store the relevant timestamps.
Method: Use simple string matching or regex to identify segments with a high frequency of certain keywords.
3. Database
Choice: Given the simplicity and self-contained nature of the project, SQLite is a suitable choice. It doesn’t require a separate server and is easy to set up and use in Python.
Usage: Store information about processed video files, timestamps of interesting segments, and the status of ongoing tasks.
4. Video Slicing
Task: Write Python scripts to slice the videos into clips based on the timestamps identified from the chat log analysis. FFmpeg can be used for this purpose.
Automation: Set up these scripts to automatically process videos based on the data stored in the SQLite database.
5. Task Scheduling and Running
Tools: Use Python’s subprocess module to run FFmpeg commands for video conversion and slicing.
Asynchronous Execution: Implement asynchronous tasks using Python’s asyncio library or a task queue like Celery for handling multiple processes concurrently.
6. Deployment Considerations
Server Requirements: Ensure the server has FFmpeg installed and is capable of handling the processing load.
Automated Monitoring: Implement a system to monitor the designated directory for new videos and trigger the processing pipeline automatically.
